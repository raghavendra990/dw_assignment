#key value data store server

I have built flask application and stroing key value pair in redis database using crud operation. Later we can host it anywhere.

Install redis in your machine using http://redis.io/topics/quickstart .

install some python dependacies:

```
pip install Flask
pip install redis
```
now run app.py file.

```
python app.py
```

if everything is fine then you application sucefully start running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 .
